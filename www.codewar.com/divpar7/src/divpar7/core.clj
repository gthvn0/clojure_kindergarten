;; A number m of the form 10x + y is divisible by 7 if and only if x âˆ’ 2y is
;; divisible by 7

;; Your task is to return to the function seven(m) (m integer >= 0) an array of
;; numbers, the first being the last number m with at most 2 digits obtained by
;; your function (this last m will be divisible or not by 7), the second one
;; being the number of steps to get the result.

;; Example with 1603
;; iter1: 1603 as most than 2 digits => 160 - (2*3) = 154
;; iter2: 156 as most than 2 digits => 15 - (2*8) = 7   => divisible by 7
;; so return [ 7 2 ]

(quot 1603 10) ;; 160
(rem 1603 10) ;; 3
