# web-server

A Clojure library designed to serve request on the web. I'm using http-kit for
the server part and compojure for the routing.

## Usage

- Currently I'm only testing it using the repl. In the repl:
```
web-server.core=> (require '[web-server.core :as w])
nil
web-server.core=> (w/start-server 8080)
#'web-server.core/server
```
- And you can do: `curl http://localhost:8080`
- You should see the web page
- To stop the server in the repl just do
```
web-server.core=> (w/stop-server)
nil
```
